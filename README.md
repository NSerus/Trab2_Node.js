  You should now be able to test the API normally.

# Testing the API.

  Inserting `localhost:6666/api/` will show that the api works and there is some more functions after API that do the following:
    -`/novos` - presents the new cases of the last 7 days 
    -`/intern` - presents the cases that had to be hospitalized in the last 7 days
    -`/max-novos` - presents the day that had the most new cases
    -`/min-novos` - presents the day that had the least new cases
    -`/med-novos` - presents the average of the new cases
    -`/tot-novos` - presents all of the new cases of the week
